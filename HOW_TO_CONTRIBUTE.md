# Contributing A Metric

To contribute a metric, we recommend looking at a metric file to see how it's done. To contribute a metric, we simply ask for 3 things:

- An `assert` statement so users know
- A `Metric` class so that this can be used in other areas of the codebase
- Tests to make sure it works

And that's it!
