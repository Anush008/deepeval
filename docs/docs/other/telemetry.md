# Telemetry


We use telemetry to monitor the performance of our application and to identify any potential issues that may arise. This is done through the use of Sentry, a service that helps us track, debug, and resolve production errors in real-time.

This helps us ensure that our application is running smoothly and efficiently.

If you wish to turn off telemetry, you can do so by setting the environment variable `TURN_OFF_DEEPEVAL_TELEMETRY` to "Y". This will prevent Sentry from initializing and no data will be sent.
