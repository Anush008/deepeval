## Your Privacy Using DeepEval

`deepeval` only tracks errors and exceptions raised within the package for the purpose of improving the package. This happens **only if you have explicitly opted in to it** and \*\*does not collect any user or company data in any way\*\*. To help us catch bugs for future release, set the `ERROR_REPORTING` environment variable to 'YES'.

```console
export NO_ERROR_REPORTING="YES"
```

## Your Privacy Using Confident AI

All data sent to Confident AI is securely stored in databases within our private cloud hosted on AWS (unless your organization is on the VIP plan). **Your organization is the sole entity that can access the data you store.**

We understand that there might still be concerns regarding data security from a compliance point of view. For enhanced security and features, consider upgrading your membership [here.](https://confident-ai.com/pricing)
