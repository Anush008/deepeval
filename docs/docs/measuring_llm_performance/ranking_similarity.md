# Ranking Similarity

Top-K rankings are usually evaluated with several common criteria:

- Top results are more important than bottom-ranked results.
  A drop from 2nd to 3rd is more significant than a drop from 5th to 6th and so on.

A specific result not appearing in another list is more indicative of difference than a result dropping in another list as it suggests the ranking itself is greater than K.
