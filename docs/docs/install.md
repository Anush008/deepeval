# Installation

In order to run DeepEval, you will need Python 3.9+.

Simply run:

```bash
pip install deepeval
```

:::note


We recommend running these evaluation frameworks inside of a Docker container or fresh environment where possible as there are a number of dependencies required for the AI models to get running (sentence-transformers, transformers).
