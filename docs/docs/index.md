# DeepEval

DeepEval provides a Pythonic way to run offline evaluations on your LLM pipelines so you can launch comfortably into production.

## Why we wrote this library

While the growth of LLMs, LangChain, LlamaIndex became prominent- we found that once these pipelines were built, it became really hard to continue iterating on these pipelines. Many engineers wanted to use LangChain as a quick start and then start adding guardrails, switch LLMs to Llama2.
