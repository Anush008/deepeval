## Quick Summary

`deepeval` offers multiple integrations for those who have already built LLM apps using other frameworks. We currently support:

- lLamaindex
- _LangChain (to be documented...)_
- _Guardrails (to be documented...)_

You're by no means required to leverage these integrations to use `deepeval` as we are not vendor locked into any framework. After all, all we need is data being passed to `deepeval` to evaluate your LLM application. However, you may find our integrations helpful in keeping your codebase cleaner, so we recommend giving it a try if you're looking to optimize for readability and maintability.
